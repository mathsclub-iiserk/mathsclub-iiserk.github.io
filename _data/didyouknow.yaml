        All positive integers are interesting. Proof: Assume the contrary.
        Then there is a lowest non-interesting positive integer. But, hey,
        that's pretty interesting! A contradiction.

        The greenhouse effect was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824.
- fact: >
        There are infinitely many composite numbers. For a proof, suppose there
        are finitely many.  Multiply them and most importantly, do not add one.
        This is a new composite number, a contradiction!

        Wiener was once invited to lecture in China. He wanted to begin his
        first lecture with a little Chinese, so he spoke some words. The
        Chinese listened very politely. It was later observed that what Wiener
        actually said was "The cow is green."

        After John Nash won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994, a small
        ceremony was held in the Fine Hall Common Room at Princeton University.
        Nash was persuaded to make a few remarks. His first was, "I hope that
        getting the Nobel will improve my credit rating, because I really want
        a credit card."

        Erdos liked to joke about death, and about senility. He frequently made
        jokes about the loss of brain power.  Attributed to Erdos (but perhaps
        originated from Ulam) are the three steps in the mental degeneration of
        a mathematician: <br>
        • First you forget your theorems.<br>
        • Next you forget to zip up.<br>
        • Last you forget to zip down.

        Many years ago, Gerhard Hochschild, who set high standards for himself
        and for everyone else, submitted a paper to the Annals. The referee's
        report said, "Good enough for the Annals. Not good enough for
        Hochschild.  Rejected."

        Paul J. Cohen (Fields Medalist, 1966), who was a professor at Stanford
        University for many years, always liked to complain about how lazy the
        students were. One day he fell asleep in his office. In fact he slept
        through the class he was supposed to teach. Then he went to the office
        of his neighbor to complain about how lazy the students are. He
        followed this by returning to his office and going back to sleep.

        Bertrand Russell was once asked whether he was prepared to die for his
        beliefs. "Of course not," he replied immediately. "After all, I may be
        wrong."

        Littlewood once challenged Hardy to find a misprint in one of their
        joint papers. His collaborator was unable to do so. In fact, the
        misprint was in his own name: "G, H. Hardy."

        Archimedes was devoted to his mathematics, and the lack of a convenient
        writing surface was hardly sufficient to hinder his efforts. After
        leaving his bath he would anoint his body with olive oil, and then
        trace his calculations with a fingernail on the oily skin.
- fact: >
        In the 1930's and 1940's, a theorem was "true in the sense of Henri
        Cartan" if Grauert could not find a counterexample in the space of an
        hour.

        Paul Erdos had a simple motto: Another roof, another proof.
