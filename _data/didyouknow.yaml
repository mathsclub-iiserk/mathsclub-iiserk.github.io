- fact: "There are infinitely many primes. As a result, there are infinitely
        many odd numbers!"
- fact: "The number 1729 is called Ramanujan's number, ever since he noticed
        that this is the smallest integer which can be expressed as the sum of two
        positive integer cubes in two different ways!"
- fact: "All positive integers are interesting.
        Proof: Assume the contrary.
        Then there is a lowest non-interesting positive integer. But, hey, that's
        pretty interesting! A contradiction."
- fact: "Contributions to this section are welcome!"
