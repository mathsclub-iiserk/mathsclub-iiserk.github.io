        All positive integers are interesting. Proof: Assume the contrary.
        Then there is a lowest non-interesting positive integer. But, hey,
        that's pretty interesting! A contradiction.

        There are infinitely many composite numbers. For a proof, suppose
        there are finitely many.  Multiply them and most importantly, do not
        add one.  This is a new composite number, a contradiction!

        Wiener was once invited to lecture in China. He wanted to begin his
        first lecture with a little Chinese, so he spoke some words. The
        Chinese listened very politely. It was later observed that what Wiener
        actually said was "The cow is green."

        After John Nash won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994, a small
        ceremony was held in the Fine Hall Common Room at Princeton
        University.  Nash was persuaded to make a few remarks. His first was,
        "I hope that getting the Nobel will improve my credit rating, because
        I really want a credit card."

        Erdos liked to joke about death, and about senility. He frequently
        made jokes about the loss of brain power. Attributed to Erdos (but
        perhaps originated from Ulam) are the three steps in the mental
        degeneration of a mathematician: <br>

        • Last you forget to zip down.

        Many years ago, Gerhard Hochschild, who set high standards for himself
        and for everyone else, submitted a paper to the Annals. The referee's
        report said, "Good enough for the Annals. Not good enough for
        Hochschild. Rejected."

        Paul J. Cohen (Fields Medalist, 1966), who was a professor at Stanford
        University for many years, always liked to complain about how lazy the
        students were. One day he fell asleep in his office. In fact he slept
        through the class he was supposed to teach. Then he went to the office
        of his neighbor to complain about how lazy the students are. He
        followed this by returning to his office and going back to sleep.

        Bertrand Russell was once asked whether he was prepared to die for his

        Littlewood once challenged Hardy to find a misprint in one of their
        joint papers. His collaborator was unable to do so. In fact, the
        misprint was in his own name: "G, H. Hardy."

        Archimedes was devoted to his mathematics, and the lack of a
        convenient writing surface was hardly sufficient to hinder his
        efforts. After leaving his bath he would anoint his body with olive
        oil, and then trace his calculations with a fingernail on the oily
        skin.

        In the 1930's and 1940's, a theorem was "true in the sense of Henri
        Cartan" if Grauert could not find a counterexample in the space of an
        hour.

        Renato Caccioppoli was an atheist and a huge anticlerical; neverthless
        his assistant at university was don Savino Coronato, a priest.  Once,
        during an exam, don Savino wrote an ODE on the blackboard and asked a
        student to solve it; the poor guy wasn't able to solve it and didn't
        pass. But ... the ODE don Savino wrote wasn't by no means solvable in
        elementary terms! Caccioppoli didn't say anything but, after the
        students were all gone, he came close to don Savino and mocked, "There
        are only two guys that can solve that ODE you wrote: me and your boss".

        "Oh, he seems like an okay person, except for being a little strange
        in some ways. All day he sits at his desk and scribbles, scribbles,
        scribbles. Then, at the end of the day, he takes the sheets of paper
        he's scribbled on, scrunches them all up, and throws them in the trash
        can." - John von Neumann's housekeeper, describing her employer.

        "Algebraic geometry seems to have acquired the reputation of being
        esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are
        secretly plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics. In one
        respect this last point is accurate." - David Mumford

        A certain well known mathematican, upon his arrival at Harvard
        University, was scheduled to teach Math 1a (the first semester of
        freshman calculus.) He asked his fellow faculty members what he was
        supposed to teach in this course, and they told him, "limits,
        continuity, differentiability, and a little bit of indefinite
        integration". <br>
        The next day he came back and asked, "What am I supposed to cover in
        the second lecture?"<br>

        Although David Hilbert was one of the first to deal seriously with
        infinite-dimensional complete inner product spaces, the practice of
        calling them after him was begun by others, supposedly without his
        knowledge. The story goes that one day a visitor came to Göttingen and
        gave a seminar about some theorem on "Hilbert spaces". At the end of
        the lecture, Hilbert raised his hand and asked, "What is a Hilbert
        space?"
