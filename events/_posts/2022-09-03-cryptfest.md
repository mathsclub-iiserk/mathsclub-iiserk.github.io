## About

CryptFest, a day-long Treasure Hunt, was successfully conducted on 3 September,
2022, on IISER Kolkata campus premises. Overall, we saw participation of 12
teams with a total of 38 participants. Three teams made it to the very end,
while only two correctly navigated the final twist!


## Our winners

1. **Team Ko-mew-traitors** (_Trishita Patra_, _Dakshesh Vasan_, _Praful
   Rahangdale_, _Aditya Dutta_): They correctly retrieved and guessed 2/5
   Finale Chits, also holding the record for the fastest to find a chit
   (_Wazzt_) and also the ones to find the last remaining chit (_Abisah_).
2. **Team ^_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__^** (_Priyaraj Pal_, _Sai Kishore N_): They also
   retrieved two Finale Chits but could only guess one (_Lagrange_). They were
   also a two person team so props to them for that!
3. **Team Dora the Explorers** (_Raakesh M_, _VishalRaam CS_, _Adireddi
   Srinivas_, _Liyana Shehaban Shajahan_): They retrieved one Finale Chit but
   unfortunately couldn't guess its author correctly. Nevertheless, their
   achievements are crucial enough to put them in our Top 3.

Our honourable mention goes to **Team Biologist** (_Vaishali Mulchandani_,
_Chirag Singhal_, _Souvik Karmakar_, _Anurag Banerjee_). They were just a
little late to retrieve two Finale Chits! However, they did provide us with the
fastest solution to the Easter Egg Challenge - finding a secret hidden in an
arbitrary clue.

## Rules and guidelines

1. At *10 am, Sep 3* - a mail will be sent to all of the registered email
   addresses. This mail will contain an initial set of clues that will be
   *crucial* to progressing as well as decoding the final solution. Call this
   *Clue#1*.
2. Based upon *Clue#1* (which would be fairly simple), you can start
   pinpointing locations for the next clue. You do not have to roam around
   aimlessly and can get a very precise location the better you understand the
   clue. At your first location you shall get *Clue#2.* This would be the same
   for everyone.
3. You have to take an image of Clue#2 as it is and send it to us first
   *mandatorily*. This is to ensure that you don't tamper with the clues and
   other groups can access them too. If we find that someone has tampered with
   a clue we will unequivocally give the solution to all the other groups
   (except the tampering agents). _Make sure to send us the image of the clue
   by email before you start decoding it._
4. Solving *Clue#2* will take you to *Clue#3* and so on (don't forget to send
   us images of every single clue). *Caution:* After a while, *Clues* will
   become more vague, and based upon your interpretation can lead you along
   different paths. Therefore, do not just stalk another group - they might
   have taken the longer route while you guys could've made it early if you did
   some work.
5. _Every single path_, if solved correctly will lead to _1 of 5_ different
   *finale-chits*, that would give you a short 1-3 line story. These stories
   would correspond to our five guests, *Wazzt*, *Ramabas*, *Lagrange*, *Taya*,
   *Abisah*. Not only do you have to bring back these *finale-chits*, you also
   have to correctly deduce which one of our guests wrote it (there will be
   hints in the clues for the same).
6. Unlike Clues, *finale-chits* should *not be shared with anyone* (this will
   be mentioned clearly on them). No one is stopping groups from working
   together, but know that if multiple groups report back to us with the same
   answers simultaneously, *at most one* of the groups will be given credit
   based on our discretion. Therefore, be cautious before working together -
   and try not to share the Finale chit that you found with anyone except us.
7. Around *4 pm*, we will send a mail to all the registered email addresses
   again on where to meet for the final report. Everyone who wants to report
   should be at the location by *6 pm sharp*. Latecomers won't be entertained.


## Tips and tricks

1. Clues will be meddled in ciphers and riddles (mostly ciphers). No knowledge
   of core mathematics is required, but some knowledge of basic ciphers
   (Caesar, Substitution) and binary/Hex/Oct/Dec/ASCII representations would be
   expected.
2. Participants are allowed to use any online or offline resources they want,
   ~~except asking help from other people on campus (because then why form
   groups na?)~~. ~~Online cipher decoder applications are not recommended and
   are generally discouraged because they take the fun out of the event (*but
   no one is stopping you ;>*)~~
3. A diverse group of people would be helpful to decipher the clues. We know
   people love unisex, uniMajor, unicommunity or uni*IdentityCrisis* teams.
   Diverse teams are recommended, but not mandatory.
4. You may ask for hints/clues by mailing us in this mail handle.  However,
   whether we actually give out any clues or not is entirely our discretion.
   Also remember that if we decide that it's better to give out the clue, we
   will *give the clue to everyone, not just the person who asked*. Make sure
   to do some strategic planning before you ask for help.
5. Carry copies/sheets of paper with you to copy down any clues you come
   across. *Please do not tamper with clues or write on them or displace them.*
   This is a fun event, let us all follow the rules.


## Awards

- Every *finale-chit* has **Rs 100** allotted to it. If one group were to get a
  chit first and correctly guess its writer, they would win the 100 rupees.
  However, if nobody gets it or nobody is able to guess the correct name, the
  *guest who wrote the chit* will get the 100 rupees.
- Similarly, for every *finale-chit*: if some group decodes it correctly, they
  get the award. If no group can, the guests get the award.
- To make things challenging, once some group has found a *finale-chit* and
  wrongly deduced the name, no other group can try on that particular chit. The
  first people to bring back a finale chit are the only ones eligible to speak
  on it.
