## About

In the cold, cold winter in some other universe, Gauss has breathed his last
under mysterious circumstances. Even though the case is complicated and eludes
those on it, the answer is embedded through letters stained red, correspondence
that is hidden in the most jubilant of math problems. Among the many
mathematicians who have almost inadvertently been pulled into this drama, can
you figure out the hidden perpetrator(s) and their motives?

In an event like none before, Identity presents Gaussian Elimination, an
alternate historical tale of love and betrayal, crime and sex (and math).
