## About

Identity hosts _Problem's Unknown, Proof Set in Stone_, a relay race, played in
teams of four. Pairs of groups face off, trying to prove a mathematical
statement as quickly as possible. The catch? Only one team member is allowed at
the board at a time; after their allotted time of 3 minutes is up, their
successor must take over. Nobody but the people at the board (and our audience)
has knowledge of the given problem. When passing on the baton, only 15 seconds
are given for communication.

Four teams entered the contest.

- _Sus-Pan-Raj_ (Joydwip Singh, Sandip Samanta, Habibur Rahaman, Mukilraj K)
- _Morphism_ (Vishalraam CS, Shibashis Mukhopadhyay, Tarak Yadav, Abhisruta Maity)
- _ARKS_ (Anunay Chandra, Rithwik Raina, Kishan Saha, Adireddi Srinivas)
- _Noether Boys_ (Manish Kumar, Jebasingh R, Rajiv Mishra, Soudip Kundu)

## Bonus

The following problem remained unsolved at the board; can you finish it off?

_Let $x > 0$. Consider the sequence of power towers $\\{x_n\\}\_{n \in
\mathbb{N}}$, defined by $x\_1 = x$, $x\_{n + 1} = x^{x\_n}$.  If this sequence
is given to converge, show that $x < \sqrt{3}$._
