Wishing you all a very Happy Pi Day, 2022! It's 3/14, the day to celebrate one
of the most renowned constants in mathematics. 

On this mathspicious occasion, we are announcing a Mathematics Article Writing
Contest! All students are invited to participate, irrespective of their
department or discipline. We want this to be an opportunity for you to share
your thoughts and perspective on mathematics. Due to our limited resources, we
are restricting the nature of these articles to two broad categories.

1. _Math explainers_: delve deep into one particular facet of mathematics,
   perhaps some interesting and innovative way of solving a problem, and
   explain what you know.
2. _Math beyond_: show how mathematics is involved in or applies to a different
   subject, maybe in some unexpected way.

We want to emphasize that these articles should be comprehensible by a broad
audience, and presented in a way that a +2 student would be able to understand
and appreciate. The best five submissions will be published on our website;
besides, we have exciting (perhaps unusual) prizes in store! The first, second,
and third ranked participants will receive **Rs. 314**, **Rs. 265**, and **Rs.
159** respectively. Rest assured that your article will be judged in a fair and
objective manner by a panel of our own professors.

The contest officially closes on ~~31 March~~ **15 April**.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
