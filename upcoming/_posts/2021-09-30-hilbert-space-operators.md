## Abstract

On finite dimensional space, the spectral theorem provides the classification
for normal operators. Similar results do hold for normal operators on infinite
dimensional Hilbert space as well. However, beyond normal operators, very
little is known. One of the many approaches is to study the operators by
realizing them as part of so-called nice operators such as normal operators.
This leads to the well known model theory introduced by Nagy-Foias and the
theory of subnormal operators introduced by Halmos. The study of reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces. e.r. Hardy spaces, Bergman spaces, etc. and study of
operators on them, e.g Toeplitz operators, Hankel operators, etc. came into
prominence subsequently and applied successfully to various interpolation
problems. Inequalities such as von Neumann inequality, Grothendieck inequality
related these studies generated huge interest in the recent past. In this talk,
we would try to give a glimpse of these studies in one and multi-variable setup
and discuss some problems, if time permits.
