    _Abstract:_ Let R be a Noetherian ring and I ⊂ R be an ideal. Let μ(-)
    denote the minimal number of generators. It is well known that there is a
    sequence of inequalities μ(I/I²) ≤ μ(I) ≤ μ(I/I²)+1 that are strict in

## Abstract

Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and $I \subset R$ be an ideal. Let $\mu(-)$ denote
the minimal number of generators. It is well known that there is a sequence of
inequalities $\mu(I/I^2) \leq \mu(I) \leq \mu(I/I^2)+1$ that are strict in
general. Attaining the equality with the lower bound has been the content of
many articles in the literature. This depends hugely on the types of rings and
the nature of ideals therein, and in this talk we will discuss them.
