## Abstract

Our first encounter with the natural numbers and integers was in primary
school. We first learned to count and then gradually we learned addition,
subtraction, multiplication etc. Let us forget about them for a moment. In this
talk we shall formally construct the natural numbers (starting from "nothing"!)
and then define addition. We shall then see that the natural numbers are, in
some sense, "incomplete". Then integers will be constructed formally, to
resolve that crisis. If time permits, I shall also give a sketch on
multiplication. Only the knowledge of basic set theory (high school level) and
the notion of equivalence relation will be required to follow the talk.
