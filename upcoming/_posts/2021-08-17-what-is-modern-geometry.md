## Abstract

After a quick overview of the history of geometry, and an outline of the
sub-fields of modern geometry, I shall give a crash course on the differential
geometry of curves and surfaces. In particular, I hope to state Theorem
Egregium, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the Uniformisation theorem.
