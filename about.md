# About us

We are _Identity_, the _Maths Club of IISER Kolkata_; closely tied with the
_Department of Mathematics and Statistics, IISER Kolkata_. Welcome to our
official website!

_Identity_ is an initiative to bring exposition and discourse on interesting
topics in maths to a wider audience. We host talks delivered by experts in
various fields in mathematics, publish articles and short video demonstrations,
and hold monthly problem-solving contests. Our content is geared mostly towards
undergraduate students, but can be enjoyed by anyone with a basic understanding
and appreciation for mathematics.
