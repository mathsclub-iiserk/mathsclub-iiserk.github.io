title: Circles to Numbers
author: Rohan Didmishe
blurb: >
    When learning Calculus or Analysis for the first time, it can feel as if
    the entire subject is only about computation; one can forget the forest for
    the trees so to speak, and it all seems a bit arbitrary. However, there is
    no subject in mathematics that is an island; and Analysis is one such
    branch which is at the heart of nearly all branches of mathematics. For
    this particular article, I want to show how basic geometry that one learns
    before 11th/12th is connected with the abstract analysis that comes
    afterwards.

## Geometric point of view

In school, one usually learns about trigonometry from triangles and circles.
Just to recall, if one has a right angled triangle $\Delta PDO$ (with the right
angle at $D$), then the sine and cosine of $\angle POD = \theta$ is given by

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{PD}{OP}, \qquad \cos\theta = \frac{OD}{OP}. $$

These are the fundamental trigonometric definitions from which everything else
in the subject can be derived. However, this definition can only work for
angles which are less than $90^\circ$ - we can consider them to be functions
mapping $(0, 90^\circ)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ - so what do we do for more general
triangles, or in mathematical terms, how do we extend the domain of definition
for other angles?
