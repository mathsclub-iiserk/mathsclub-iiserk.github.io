## A simple proof related to pi

The first published statement of this result was in 1971 by Dalzell. It was also
presented as a problem in the 1968 Putnam Competition, and later it also came in the
_JEE-Adv_. The problem was to compute the integral,

$$ \int_0^1 \frac{x^4(1 - x)^4}{1 + x^2}\:dx. $$

I encourage readers to try it at first.

_Solution:_

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^1 \frac{x^4(1 - x)^4}{1 + x^2}\:dx 
&= \int_0^1 x^6 - 4x^5 + 5x^4 - 4x^2 + 4 - \frac{4}{1 + x^2} \:dx \\
&= \left[\frac{x^7}{7} - \frac{2x^6}{3} + x^5 - \frac{4x^3}{3} + 4x - 4\arctan{x}\right]_0^1 \\
&= \frac{1}{7} - \frac{2}{3} + 1 - \frac{4}{3} + 4 - \pi \\
&= \frac{22}{7} - \pi.
\end{aligned}
$$

Now observe one thing:

$$ \frac{x^4(1 - x)^4}{1 + x^2} > 0 \implies 
\int_0^1 \frac{x^4(1 - x)^4}{1 + x^2}\:dx > 0. $$

Hence,

$$ \frac{22}{7} > \pi. $$
