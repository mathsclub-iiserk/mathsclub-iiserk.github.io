Imagine solving an exercise problem in which there are 66 sub divisions.
Yes, you read it right! That is exactly what Exercise 6.19 of Richard Stanley's
Enumerative Combinatorics asks one to do. The beauty of the exercise is that
all those questions are related to one concept â€“ Catalan numbers. Stanley then
went on to write a book titled Catalan numbers which contained more than 200
applications of this famous sequence of numbers. What is so special about this
sequence that it has a monologue dedicated to it? Let's explore and have fun.

We begin with a real life motivation. A group of friends (even number of them)
meet in a get together event. They start playing a game. The game involves them
to sit in a circular formation and shake hands. The main rule is that one
person should be involved in only one handshake. Also all of them should shake
hands (these two conditions force us to have an even number of people). One of
those excited persons in that group, in an attempt to make the game
interesting, actually brings another restriction to the game. They don't want
two pairs of hands crossing each other, while shaking hands. The players now
are interested in finding the number of ways in which they can do this task.
So, let us help them in this endeavour ...
