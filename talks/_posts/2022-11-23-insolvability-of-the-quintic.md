## Abstract

The nonexistence of a solution to a generic algebraic equation of degree 5 (or
higher than 5) as a finite combination of its coefficients using radicals and
finite field operations is one of the first and the most important
impossibility results in mathematics known as the Abel-Ruffini Theorem. The
usual proof is not  accessible without the machinery of the Galois theory.
Lecturing to Moscow High School students in 1963-1964, Arnold provided an
elementary proof of this fundamental result. I will attempt to explain his
proof.
