## Breaking the Riemann Integral

**Speaker:** _Mr Rohan Didmishe_

Riemann Integration is the standard type of integral taught in basic courses, while more advanced courses move on to the Lebesgue Integral. The talk explores the construction of an instructive example which I constructed to show the main defect in Riemann integration because of which generalisation is desirable, by showing even improper integration fails.

## The World of Triangular Partitions

**Speaker:** _Mr Safarul Rasheed_

 An integer partition is a way of writing a positive integer as a sum of positive integers. We will be exploring the concept of a triangular partition, which is an integer partition that can be represented by a diagram living inside a triangle. We will see certain properties of triangular partitions and a quite appealing characterization of them using the notion of balanced words over a binary alphabet. Using this characterization, we will attempt to tackle an interesting problem regarding the closure of an 'addition' operation on triangular partitions. Fortunately or not, the outcome of this attempt will reveal new questions to understand and attempt to answer.
