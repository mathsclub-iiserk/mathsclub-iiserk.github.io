    In our first season of Student Talks, Abhilash talks about modelling
    hydrocarbon molecules using graph theory, while Abhisruta proves a result
    analogous to Dirichlet's Approximation Theorem using transformations on
    lattice points.

## From Graphs to Graphite: Modelling Molecules with Graphs

**Speaker:** _Abhilash Saha_

We model certain covalently bonded hydrocarbons as planar graphs, and use
elementary results on graph theory to establish possible structures of
molecules from their formulas.

## Can Lattice Points Approximate Irrationals?

**Speaker:** _Abhisruta Maity_

Based on the treatises of Hilbert and Erd≈ës, we try to explore the Diophantine
approximations (i.e. approximating irrational numbers by rational numbers with
good accuracy) through lattice grids and affine transformations. We finally
arrive at a weaker version of Dirichlet's Approximation Theorem. By this
approach, we get a glimpse of a bridge connecting geometry of a discrete sense
to number theory of analytic taste.
