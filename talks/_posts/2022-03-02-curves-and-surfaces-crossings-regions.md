## Abstract

An interesting question surfaced (pun intended) in the 1800's: What is the
largest number of regions into which one can divide a given surface so that
every two regions share a segment of frontier boundary? (This question is
related to, but not the same as the generalization of the four color conjecture
to all surfaces) The answer was found in 1968 after a long and winding
historical road.

The first part of this talk will consist of a discussion of some stretches of
this fascinating  road, profusely illustrated by surfaces crocheted\* by the
speaker with maps having the maximal number of regions (with each pair of
regions sharing a segment of boundary). Some of these explicit higher genus
surface maps were recently determined by undergraduate students Yanbing Gu,
Connor Steward and Ajmain Yamin.

In the second part of this talk we will discuss patterns related to curves on
surfaces: Two closed curves on a surface that can be deformed one into the
other (sliding, stretching, contracting is allowed, breaking is forbidden) are
called equivalent. Each of the members of this class crosses itself a certain
number of times. The smallest number of these crossing numbers is the
self-intersection number of the class. We will discuss relations between the
length and the number of crossings of closed curves on a surface. There are
also dramatic statistical patterns  which are surprising or even unexpected by
experts.

_\* Note for the uninitiated: crochet is a fiber craft similar to knitting_
