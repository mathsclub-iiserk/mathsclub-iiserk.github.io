## Abstract

Hidden beneath what has been advertised as a Hesse Derivative, I mostly want to share the invaluable insights I gained from my enriching internship experience at ETH which, had I known them earlier, would have undoubtedly transformed my approach to mathematics. As I stand on the threshold of bidding farewell to IISERK, I have tailored this talk with utmost care, keeping in mind the eager minds of our first and second year students. Since a large part of the paper only used elementary methods, I will try to demonstrate how seemingly simple tools, when thoroughly understood, can propel us to extraordinary heights!



## About the Speaker

Sayan Dutta is a fifth year BS-MS student, Department of Mathematics and
Statistics, IISER Kolkata.
