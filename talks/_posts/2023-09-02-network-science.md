## Abstract

In this talk, I will introduce the basic definitions in graph theory and some
of its applications in diverse fields of science. After that, we will move
toward a meta-population model of COVID-19 and its control strategy. I will
also discuss a network-based epidemic spread model and vaccination strategies.
Further, I will introduce a newly developed epidemic-spreading model drawing
inspiration from opinion dynamics and also discuss several control strategies.
Now, switching gears I will show a mass-transfer model in a Rock-Paper-Scissor
2D lattice and discuss phase transition. Then I will move towards representing
the brain in a network setting and discuss above establishing connection
between brain structure and function. Next up, I will briefly present
ecological networks of antagonism and mutualism and several network
characteristics and trait evolution dynamics. Finally, I will mention network
economics and my most recent encounters in trade networks and infrastructure
development. In this whole talk, I will mainly talk about my several research
works (both published or ongoing) to give a flavour of network science.


_This talk was organized in collaboration with Biome and Gluon._
