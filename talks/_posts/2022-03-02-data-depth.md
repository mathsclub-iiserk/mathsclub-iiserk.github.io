## Abstract

Statistical depth functions were introduced to provide a center-outward
ordering of the points in the ambient space with respect to a data or
probability distribution on that space. In this talk, we will introduce data
depth for univariate and multivariate data along with some of their properties
and statistical uses. We will then generalize these concepts for
functional/infinite dimensional data and discuss some of the
problems/challenges/open questions related to depth functions for such data.
