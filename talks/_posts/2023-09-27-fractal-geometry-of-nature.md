## Abstract

The geometry of natural objects differs from that of 'idealized' objects that
one studies in a geometry course. In this talk, I'll first take a closer look
at the concept of dimension of a geometrical object and will show that the
dimension can be a fractional number. Then I will show how the concept of
fractional dimension becomes important in characterizing not only natural
objects, but also structures one encounters in the study of dynamics. The
second part of the lecture will deal with the space where images (i.e., compact
subsets of the $\mathbb{R}^2$ space) live. I'll show that it is a complete
metric space, and by suitably defining a contraction mapping using a set of
affine transforms, one can obtain a Cauchy sequence that converges on any
desired image. That gives a powerful tool to codify any image as a collection
of matrices. Finally I shall illustrate a few practical applications.
