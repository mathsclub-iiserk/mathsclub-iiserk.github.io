# Monthly Contests

This is an archive of all monthly contests organized by the club. Every month,
an interesting problem is posted; solutions are received over a period of 3
weeks. The best solutions are awarded and shared by the end of the month.

<div class="post-block">
    <ul>
        {% for post in site.categories.contests %}
            <li>
                <span class="post-date"> {{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }} </span>
                <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
                {% if post.author %}
                    <span class="dot">â€¢</span>
                    <span class="post-author">{{ post.author }}</span>
                {% endif %}
                {% if post.blurb %}
                    <div class="post-blurb">{{ post.blurb | markdownify }}</div>
                {% endif %}
