# Contests/Discussions

This is an archive of all contests and discussions organized by the club.
Typically, an interesting problem is posted periodically, and solutions are
received over a period of 3 weeks. The best solutions are awarded and shared by
the end of the month.

<div class="post-block">
    <ul>
        {% for post in site.categories.contests %}
            <li>
                <span class="post-date"> {{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }} </span>
                <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
                {% if post.author %}
                    <span class="dot">â€¢</span>
                    <span class="post-author">{{ post.author }}</span>
